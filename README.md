# Shadows Of Redemption
 
This is a game I've been thinking about for a long time and now I am trying to make it a reality, but with one constraint "Only use Standard Library". It makes a lot of things interesting and lets me learn a lot of new things. 

From Previous Projects: KVF_Parsing, smooth_console and templater 

Initial Part-1: Made working engine, gameplay system, input system, and a crude rendering for the game.

Initial Part-2: Made a better Input system and rendering system and added ansi_color support for smooth_console.

1st Major Update: Made the rendering better by adding Camera and FOV to the game.

Remainder (to myself): This is a passion project focused on learning
